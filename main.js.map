Indian Space Research Organisation(ISRO) chief K Sivan said ,It is an important milestone for the Indian Space Programme towards achieving self-reliance in launching heavier satellites.The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-Mk III) is India’s most advanced and powerful rocket.      With its second successful flight, GSLV Mk III will be declared “operational”.The big tech increment in GSLV is its cryogenic engine, which uses liquefied gases to extract powerful thrust, and its S200 solid core engine which is the world’s third largest.  It was a cryogenic engine that powered Nasa’s Saturn V rocket, which took Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the moon.  The GSLV Mk-III will be used as the launch vehicle for India’s first spaceflight programme scheduled for 2022.   The launch took place amid a threat of worsening weather conditions, due to Cyclone Gaja. But the cyclone changed course, allowing the launch to go ahead.\",\r\n      publishedon: \"18/08/2018\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      title:\r\n        \"US satellite startup that chose ISRO for launch is back online after defying US officials\",\r\n      description:\r\n        \"In January, Swarm Technologies Inc. placed four, tiny satellites on a rocket owned by the Indian government, sent them to space and started transmitting data to earth.

Indian Space Research Organisation(ISRO) chief K Sivan said ,It is an important milestone for the Indian Space Programme towards achieving self-reliance in launching heavier satellites.The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-Mk III) is India’s most advanced and powerful rocket.      With its second successful flight, GSLV Mk III will be declared “operational”.The big tech increment in GSLV is its cryogenic engine, which uses liquefied gases to extract powerful thrust, and its S200 solid core engine which is the world’s third largest.  It was a cryogenic engine that powered Nasa’s Saturn V rocket, which took Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the moon.  The GSLV Mk-III will be used as the launch vehicle for India’s first spaceflight programme scheduled for 2022.   The launch took place amid a threat of worsening weather conditions, due to Cyclone Gaja. But the cyclone changed course, allowing the launch to go ahead.\",\r\n      publishedon: \"18/08/2018\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      title:\r\n        \"US satellite startup that chose ISRO for launch is back online after defying US officials\",\r\n      description:\r\n        \"In January, Swarm Technologies Inc. placed four, tiny satellites on a rocket owned by the Indian government, sent them to space and started transmitting data to earth.

As far as anyone can remember, this was the first example of an American company placing a satellite into orbit without Uncle Sam’s blessing, and the results were as expected.\",\r\n      publishedon:
